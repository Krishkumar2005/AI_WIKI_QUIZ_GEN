        "summary": "Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity (special and general) and the mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc². He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. His career spanned major institutions in Europe and the United States, where he settled permanently in 1933 after fleeing the Nazis. His 1905 'Annus Mirabilis' papers fundamentally changed physics. Late in life, he pursued a unified field theory and famously objected to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.",
